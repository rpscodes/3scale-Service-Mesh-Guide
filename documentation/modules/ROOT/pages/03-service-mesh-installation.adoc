[#controlplane]
== Service Mesh Control Plane Overview
We will be installing Elasticsearch, Jaeger, and Kiali for tracing and monitoring purposes. These are not mandatory for a general service mesh installation but are helpful in tracing the route of the calls, monitoring the mesh etc.  

[#elastic]
=== Elastic Search Operator Installation
. On your OpenShift Console UI, navigate to Administrator > Operators > OperatorHub and search for *OpenShift Elastic Operator*. Select the Operator and Click Install.

After all you have installed all four Operators, click Operators â†’ Installed Operators to verify that your Operators installed

[#create-control-plane]
=== Create Control Plane

The control plane manages and configures the proxies that make up the data plane. It is the authoritative source for configuration, manages access control and usage policies, and collects metrics from the proxies in the service mesh. You can deploy a basic ServiceMeshControlPlane by using the web console or CLI. We will be using the CLI for our demo.

. Open the terminal on your workstation. SSH into the cluster bastion via the credentials you obtained in your welcome email which should look like the images below

. Create new project with the name 'istio-system'
+
[.lines_7]
[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc new-project istio-system
----

. Create a Custom Resource Definition file for the Control Plane with name 'ServiceMeshControlPlane_basic.yaml' using vim or any other editor on the cli. Copy paste the below yaml into the file and save it.
