[#overview]
== 3scale Product Overview
A 3scale product is a customer facing API. Products facilitate the creation of strong and simplified offerings for API consumers. In this section we will configure a 3scale product. Later we will use the Istio Ingress to the BookInfo application (created in the previous step) directly as an API Product in 3scale, using the 3scale Istio WASM module
